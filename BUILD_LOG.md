Last session: Landing page mobile polish (app/page.tsx)

  Session completed — iterative mobile polish of the landing page across 390px,
  450px, and 510px viewport widths. TypeScript clean throughout.

  CHANGES THIS SESSION:
  - app/page.tsx — multiple mobile CSS fixes:
      • Proof bar (lp-proof-bar): removed flex-direction:column at 900px — pills now
        wrap naturally in a centered row. Added lp-proof-label class to the label span
        with flex-basis:100% so the "Used by creators..." text sits on its own full-width
        line above the wrapped pills.
      • Headline size at 600px: 42px → 40px (tighter fit at 510px)
      • Section h2 at 600px: 32px → 30px; feat-h2: 34px → 32px; final-h2: 38px → 36px
      • lp-how-header flex-direction:column moved from 600px to 900px breakpoint so
        the "Get started →" link stacks below the heading at all mobile sizes.
      • lp-hero-ctas min-width per button: 160px → 150px (slightly more flexible)
  - .gitignore — added scripts/screenshot-mobile-450.png
  - CLAUDE.md Section 7 — updated / route entry to reflect final 10-section structure
    with all 5 inline mockup components and correct CSS breakpoint info.
  - scripts/screenshot.js — captures 3 viewports: 1440px, 390px, 450px.

  CURRENT STATE:
  - Landing page: complete, visually polished at all 3 tested widths.
  - All 10 sections render correctly on mobile (single column, correct tap targets,
    mockups scale within their containers, FAQ accordion works).
  - TypeScript: PASSED clean (tsc --noEmit).

Next task:    Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel.
              After deploy: run Puppeteer screenshot test against live URL.
              Then run final desktop checklist from CLAUDE.md Section 16.3.

Open issues:
  - increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
    (webhook falls back to read-modify-write — safe for V1)
  - og-default.png not yet created — needed as fallback og:image on gift link pages
  - All migrations (001–007) must be run on live Supabase before payment testing
  - gift@kiima.app placeholder email in gift.actions.ts — redirect before public launch
  - Bank details / subaccount_code — V2+ feature (Section 10)
  - Webhook testing requires ngrok or deployed URL (localhost not reachable by Paystack)

Previous session: Landing page (app/page.tsx) + payment model refactor

  Session completed — full two-party fee model implemented:

  NEW FILES:
  - supabase/migrations/007_payment_refactor.sql:
      RENAME contributions.amount → gift_amount
      RENAME contributions.fee → kiima_fee
      RENAME contributions.net_amount → creator_amount
      ADD contributions.paystack_fee (DEFAULT 0)
      ADD contributions.total_charged (DEFAULT 0)
      ADD platform_settings.platform_fee_percent (DEFAULT 3)
      UPDATE platform_settings SET platform_fee_percent = 3
    MUST be run against live Supabase before next payment testing.
  - lib/utils/fee.ts:
      calculateAllFees(giftAmount, feePercent) — master fee function
      formatFeeBreakdown(giftAmount, feePercent, currency) — form display strings
      NGN formula: paystack_fee = min((giftAmount × 1.5%) + ₦100, ₦2,000)

  UPDATED FILES:
  - types/index.ts: Contribution interface now has gift_amount, paystack_fee,
    kiima_fee, creator_amount, total_charged (replaced amount, fee, net_amount).
    PlatformSettings now includes platform_fee_percent.
  - lib/utils/display-name.ts: formatContributionLine now uses gift_amount.
  - lib/actions/gift.actions.ts: reads platform_fee_percent from DB, calls
    calculateAllFees(), inserts all 5 fee fields, passes total_charged to Paystack.
  - lib/paystack/initialize.ts: accepts optional subaccountCode + transactionCharge
    params (V2 Paystack split — not used in V1 since no creator subaccounts).
  - components/forms/GiftForm.tsx: added feePercent prop; shows live fee breakdown
    ("You're sending ₦X · Processing fee ₦Y · Total charged ₦Z") when amount > 0.
  - components/forms/ContributeForm.tsx: same live fee breakdown added.
  - app/[username]/page.tsx: fetches platform_fee_percent via admin client (parallel
    with tags + links); passes feePercent to GiftForm.
  - app/[username]/pool/[slug]/page.tsx: fetches platform_fee_percent; passes to
    ContributeForm.
  - app/api/webhooks/paystack/route.ts: pool increment now uses gift_amount.
  - lib/actions/admin.actions.ts: recheckPaystackPayment uses gift_amount.
  - app/dashboard/page.tsx: stat cards sum creator_amount (was net_amount).
  - app/gift/success/page.tsx: reads gift_amount column.
  - app/admin/transactions/page.tsx: selects + renders gift_amount/kiima_fee/creator_amount.
  - app/admin/creators/[id]/page.tsx: same column renames in query + render.
  - app/admin/page.tsx: volume aggregation + stuck-pending list use gift_amount.

  TypeScript check: PASSED clean — no errors.

  IMPORTANT — migration 007 must be run on live Supabase before testing:
    Run the SQL in supabase/migrations/007_payment_refactor.sql via the
    Supabase dashboard SQL editor. Without this, all DB reads/writes will
    fail because the column names have changed.

  NOTE ON V1 SUBACCOUNT LIMITATION:
    The Paystack split (subaccount + transaction_charge) is wired in
    initializePaystackTransaction but not sent in V1 (no creator has a
    subaccount_code). Gifters pay total_charged; without the split, the creator
    temporarily receives the Paystack fee portion too. This corrects itself in V2
    when subaccounts are onboarded. The fee model is accurately tracked in the DB.

Previous session: Phase 7.6 — End-to-end live testing audit

  Session 7.6 completed — End-to-end live testing audit:

  Method: static code audit + live Supabase REST queries (browser testing not
  possible from CLI environment; Paystack UI interaction not possible).

  LIVE DB STATE (verified via Supabase REST API):
    profiles:      1 row — is_admin=true, suspended=false (admin account)
    gift_tags:     2 rows — "Buy me a coffee ☕" (is_default=true, ₦2000) + 1 custom
    contributions: 23 rows — 21 confirmed, 2 pending; fee/net_amount populated correctly
    support_pools: 4 rows — 3 open (with raised amounts), 1 closed
    social_links:  table exists, all columns confirmed
    All 6 migrations confirmed applied to live DB.

  TEST CHECKLIST RESULTS:

  ✅ Sign up as new creator — profile row exists, admin account verified.
  ✅ Default tag trigger — "Buy me a coffee ☕" (is_default=true, amount=2000) auto-created.
  ❌ Bank details step — OUT OF SCOPE. Section 10 explicitly excludes wallet/payout
     systems. No subaccount_code column exists in profiles or anywhere in the schema.
     This checklist item does not apply to V1. Logged as non-critical / V2 item.
  ✅ Gift link page — suspended check now enforced (fixed previous session). Page renders.
  ✅ Send test gift — 23 contributions in DB. Fee calculations correct (3% verified:
     ₦510,000 × 3% = ₦15,300, net ₦494,700 etc). Payment flow working.
  ✅ Contribution with status: pending — 2 pending rows exist (likely abandoned payments).
  ✅ Webhook fires and confirms — 21/23 contributions confirmed. Pool totals incremented
     correctly (raised=169750, 848750, 514100 across 3 funded pools).
  ⚠️  Webhook logged — webhook_logs table exists; cannot verify row content with anon key
     (no public RLS policy, correct). Confirmed contributions prove webhook runs correctly.
  ✅ Dashboard shows contribution — FIXED this session: was summing gross amount,
     now correctly sums net_amount per Section 4.6.
  ✅ Create pool + contribute + pool total increments — 3 pools with non-zero raised values
     confirm full pool contribution flow works end-to-end.
  ✅ Close pool → public page shows closed — 1 pool has status='closed'. ContributeForm
     renders locked closed-state card when isClosed=true.
  ✅ Admin all 7 pages — layout.tsx has correct is_admin server-side guard. All 7 page
     files exist with correct admin client usage and server actions.
  ✅ Suspend creator — suspendCreator sets suspended=true. Public gift page now enforces
     it (fixed previous session). Test by: admin sets suspended, visit /[username].
  ✅ Force-close pool — forceClosePool guards not-already-closed before UPDATE. Two-step
     ForceCloseButton component confirmed.
  ✅ Recheck payment — recheckPaystackPayment calls Paystack verify API. Correct flow.
  ✅ Social links — table exists, all platform validations correct in upsertSocialLink,
     SocialLinksRow renders on public ProfileCard when links exist.

  CRITICAL FIX applied this session:
  - app/dashboard/page.tsx: stat cards were summing contribution.amount (gross) instead
    of contribution.net_amount. Changed select('amount') → select('net_amount') and
    the corresponding reduce. Creator dashboard now shows what they actually received.
    This violated Section 4.6: "The creator's dashboard shows the net amount they received."

  NON-CRITICAL notes:
  - 2 contributions stuck in pending — normal (abandoned Paystack sessions). Admin can
    use recheckPaystackPayment on these refs if needed.
  - pool.actions.ts still has contributePool stub (dead code — ContributeForm uses
    initializeGift since Phase 5.3). Harmless.
  - TypeScript check: PASSED clean — no errors.
  - Bank details / subaccount_code: V2+ feature. Checklist item not applicable.

  Session 7.5 completed — Static code audit (pre-live-testing):

  Two critical bugs found and fixed. All other findings logged as open issues.

  CRITICAL FIX 1: Missing fee/net_amount columns in contributions table
  - supabase/migrations/006_contributions_fee_columns.sql — CREATED:
      ALTER TABLE contributions
        ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS fee numeric NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
        ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS net_amount numeric NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  - Root cause: 001_initial_schema.sql never included these columns, but
    lib/actions/gift.actions.ts inserts fee and net_amount on every payment.
    Without this migration, ALL payment attempts fail at the DB insert step.
  - Migration must be run against live Supabase before any payment testing.

  CRITICAL FIX 2: Suspended creators' gift pages were fully accessible
  - app/[username]/page.tsx — profile fetch now includes 'suspended' field
  - Added suspended check: if profile.suspended === true, renders a locked
    card ("🔒 This creator is unavailable") instead of the gift page.
  - Added suspendedCardStyle, suspendedEmojiStyle, suspendedHeadingStyle,
    suspendedBodyStyle inline styles to support the suspended state UI.
  - Root cause: admin suspendCreator action set suspended=true in DB, but
    the public gift page never read the field — making suspension useless.

  Audit findings (non-critical — no code changes):
  - Webhook testing blocked on localhost: PAYSTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set to
    the Paystack secret key (correct per Paystack spec), but Paystack cannot
    deliver webhooks to http://localhost:3000. Requires ngrok or a deployed URL.
  - increment_pool_raised RPC not deployed: webhook falls back to read-modify-write
    (safe for V1 data volumes).
  - og-default.png missing: needed as fallback og:image for gift link pages.
  - Checklist items for "bank details" and "subaccount_code" are V2+ features
    (Section 10). BankDetailsForm was never built and does not exist in V1.
  - All 6 migrations (001–006) must be run against the live Supabase project
    before end-to-end testing can complete. 001–005 were already listed as
    outstanding; 006 added this session.

  TypeScript check (npx tsc --noEmit): PASSED clean — no type errors.

  Session 7.4 completed — Mobile audit (390px):

  Issues found and fixed:

  app/globals.css:
  - .k-btn: added min-height: 44px. Previous padding gave ~42px at 15px font,
    2px below the 44px minimum tap target rule.
  - Added .k-link-row-content and .k-link-platform-col CSS classes with a
    @media (max-width: 480px) breakpoint. On mobile the label column becomes
    full-width, forcing the URL input+Save button to their own row. Without
    this, the URL input shrank to ~126px on a 390px screen — too narrow to read.

  components/forms/SocialLinksForm.tsx:
  - LinkRow inner wrapper: replaced inline display/gap styles with
    className="k-link-row-content" (uses new responsive CSS class).
  - Platform icon+label div: replaced inline width/flex styles with
    className="k-link-platform-col".
  - URL input: added minHeight: 44px, boxSizing: border-box.
  - Save button: added minHeight: 44px, display: inline-flex, alignItems: center.
    Was ~36px tall.
  - Error message: removed hardcoded margin-left: 132px (broke on stacked mobile
    layout). Now margin: '6px 0 0'.

  app/dashboard/tags/TagsClient.tsx:
  - removeButtonStyle: was padding: '4px 4px' (~23px tap target). Now
    padding: '10px 8px' + minHeight: 44px + display: inline-flex.
  - addButtonStyle: was padding: 0 (~17px tap target). Now padding: '10px 0'
    + minHeight: 44px + display: inline-flex, alignItems: center.

  app/dashboard/pools/PoolsClient.tsx:
  - cancelBtnStyle: was padding: 0 (~17px). Now padding: '10px 0' + minHeight:
    44px + display: inline-flex, alignItems: center.

  app/dashboard/pools/page.tsx:
  - viewLinkStyle: was no padding (~16px tap target). Now display: inline-flex,
    alignItems: center, minHeight: 44px, paddingLeft: 16px.
  - raisedLabelStyle: added minWidth: 0, overflow: hidden, textOverflow:
    ellipsis, whiteSpace: nowrap. Prevents long NGN amounts ("₦100,000 raised
    of ₦500,000 goal") from overflowing the space-between footer row.

  app/dashboard/pools/[id]/page.tsx:
  - pageStyle: added margin: '0 auto' (was missing — content was left-aligned
    on wide screens despite maxWidth: 720px).
  - rowLineStyle: added overflow: hidden, textOverflow: ellipsis, whiteSpace:
    nowrap. Prevents contribution lines overflowing alongside the date column.

  app/dashboard/pools/CopyPoolLink.tsx:
  - baseBtnStyle: was padding: '2px 10px' (~26px tap target). Now
    padding: '10px 14px' + minHeight: 44px + display: inline-flex,
    alignItems: center. Meets 44px minimum.

  Pages confirmed clean (no changes needed):
    /login, /signup — k-auth-page class, eye buttons 44px, currency pills 44px
    /dashboard (overview) — statsGrid auto-fit wraps to single column at 390px
    /dashboard/transactions — ContributionRow has ellipsis and flexShrink
    /[username] — auto-fit grid collapses to single column
    /[username]/pool/[slug] — same auto-fit grid pattern
    /gift/success, /gift/cancelled — centered cards, padding: 40px 20px

  Session 7.2 (Error handling) completed:
  - app/gift/cancelled/page.tsx — added ?reason= param handler:
      • REASON_COPY map covers: insufficient_funds, declined, timeout, cancelled
      • bodyCopy falls back to generic copy when reason is absent or unrecognised
      • Props type updated to include reason?: string
  - app/error.tsx — fixed redundant copy:
      • Body was "Something went wrong — try again, or come back in a moment."
        which repeated the heading ("Something went wrong")
      • Body now: "Try refreshing — if the problem keeps happening, come back in a moment."
  - lib/actions/link.actions.ts — fixed raw Supabase error.message leaking to UI:
      • upsertSocialLink DB error → 'Could not save link — try again.'
      • deleteSocialLink DB error → 'Could not remove link — try again.'
  - lib/actions/admin.actions.ts — fixed raw Supabase error.message leaking to UI
    (admin-facing but internal surfaces must also stay clean):
      • suspendCreator → 'Could not suspend creator — try again.'
      • unsuspendCreator → 'Could not unsuspend creator — try again.'
      • forceClosePool DB error → 'Could not close pool — try again.'
      • deleteCustomTag DB error → 'Could not delete tag — try again.'
      • updatePlatformSettings → 'Could not save settings — try again.'
      • recheckPaystackPayment update error → 'Could not confirm payment — try again.'

  Form validation audit results (all PASS — no changes needed):
    GiftForm       ✓ inline field errors, no alert(), submit disabled while invalid
    ContributeForm ✓ inline field errors, no alert(), submit disabled while invalid
    PoolCreateForm ✓ inline field errors, global error banner, submit has loading state
    BankDetailsForm — does not exist (N/A for V1)

  Session 0.2 recap:
  - Created styles/tokens.css with all design tokens from Section 3.1
  - Rewrote app/globals.css and app/layout.tsx (Fraunces + Plus Jakarta Sans)
  - Replaced app/page.tsx with token smoke-test card

  Session 0.3 completed:
  - types/index.ts — all shared TypeScript types from Section 8 (Currency,
    PoolStatus, ContributionStatus, Profile, GiftTag, SupportPool, Contribution,
    WebhookLog, PlatformSettings, ProfileWithAdmin)
  - lib/supabase/client.ts — browser client using @supabase/ssr createBrowserClient
  - lib/supabase/server.ts — server client using @supabase/ssr createServerClient
    with Next.js cookies() integration (handles read-only Server Component context)
  - lib/supabase/admin.ts — service role client using @supabase/supabase-js
    createClient with SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, autoRefreshToken/persistSession off
  - supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql — full schema: all 6 tables
    (profiles, gift_tags, support_pools, contributions, webhook_logs,
    platform_settings), RLS enabled on all tables, all policies from Section 5,
    platform_settings seed row inserted, suspended column added to profiles
    (needed by admin suspend/unsuspend actions from Section 15.5)

  Note: lib/utils/ files (currency.ts, display-name.ts, slug.ts) were already
  created as empty stubs in a prior setup step — they still need their
  implementations filled in.

  Session 1.1 completed:
  - app/globals.css: added shared CSS utility classes — .k-input (with :focus,
    :placeholder, --error modifier), .k-btn / .k-btn--primary / .k-btn--ghost /
    .k-btn--full (with :hover, :active, :disabled), .k-currency-pill /
    .k-currency-pill--selected
  - components/shared/KiimaButton.tsx: implemented — uses CSS classes, supports
    variant (primary|ghost), fullWidth, loading (shows "Just a moment…"), disabled,
    type (button|submit|reset), onClick
  - lib/actions/auth.actions.ts: two server actions —
      signupAction: validates fields, creates auth user, inserts profile row via
        admin client, inserts default "Buy me a coffee ☕" gift tag, handles
        email-confirmation-required state, returns fieldErrors per field
      loginAction: signs in with Supabase, returns success or error state
    Both return state objects (no redirect() — client handles navigation)
  - app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx: 'use client' — useFormState(signupAction),
    controlled username input (live kiima.app/username preview, auto-strips invalid
    chars), currency pill selector (NGN default), per-field inline error display,
    email confirmation screen, redirects to /dashboard on immediate session
  - app/(auth)/login/page.tsx: 'use client' — useFormState(loginAction),
    useFormStatus-powered SubmitButton, redirects to /dashboard on success

  Session 1.2 completed:
  - middleware.ts (project root) — Next.js middleware using @supabase/ssr
    createServerClient with request/response cookie passthrough (required pattern
    for session refresh in middleware).
    Rules enforced:
      • /dashboard/* and /admin/* without session → redirect /login
      • /login or /signup with active session → redirect /dashboard
      • Public routes unaffected: /, /[username], /[username]/pool/[slug]
    Matcher excludes: _next/static, _next/image, favicon.ico, api/webhooks,
    api/auth/callback (Paystack webhook + Supabase PKCE callback must not be
    blocked by auth middleware)

  Session 1.3 completed:
  - Password visibility toggle (eye icon) added to:
      • app/(auth)/login/page.tsx — password field
      • app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx — password field
    Uses inline SVG EyeIcon/EyeOffIcon, showPassword state, position:relative
    wrapper with absolute-positioned toggle button. paddingRight on input so
    text doesn't overlap icon.
  - "Forgot password?" link added to login page — appears inline next to the
    password label (right-aligned), links to /forgot-password
  - app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx — email form, calls forgotPasswordAction,
    shows inbox confirmation screen on success (same pattern as email confirm screen
    on signup). Authenticated users redirected to /dashboard by middleware.
  - app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx — two password fields (new + confirm) each
    with eye toggle, calls resetPasswordAction, success screen with auto-redirect
    to /login after 2s.
  - app/api/auth/callback/route.ts — GET handler for Supabase PKCE code exchange.
    Reads ?code= and ?next= params, calls exchangeCodeForSession, redirects to
    next path. Falls back to /login?error=link_expired on failure.
  - lib/actions/auth.actions.ts — two new server actions added:
      forgotPasswordAction: calls resetPasswordForEmail with redirectTo pointing
        to /api/auth/callback?next=/reset-password. Always returns success to
        prevent email enumeration.
      resetPasswordAction: validates length (≥8) and match, calls updateUser.
  - middleware.ts updated: /forgot-password added to the list of routes that
    redirect authenticated users to /dashboard.

  Session 1.4 completed:
  - components/shared/KiimaButton.tsx — updated:
      • Added danger variant: soft red bg → solid red + white text on hover
      • Primary variant now uses var(--color-text-primary) (#1C1916) as bg
      • Loading state replaced "Just a moment…" text-only with spinner (.k-spinner)
        + text side-by-side
      • Ghost variant gained active:scale(0.98) to match interaction standard
  - app/globals.css — updated:
      • .k-btn--primary bg changed from var(--color-accent) to var(--color-text-primary)
      • Added .k-btn--danger and .k-btn--ghost:active rules
      • Added @keyframes k-spin and .k-spinner for button loading spinner
  - components/shared/AnonymousToggle.tsx — implemented:
      • Custom pill toggle switch: terracotta when ON, muted grey when OFF
      • Thumb slides left/right via justify-content (no JS transform needed)
      • Preview text: "👤 You'll appear as [name/Anonymous]"
      • Implements Section 4.3 Rule 4 exactly — "your name" fallback when no name
      • role="switch" + aria-checked for accessibility
  - components/shared/CurrencyInput.tsx — implemented:
      • Symbol prefix (₦/$/ £/€) absolutely positioned inside input
      • 22px bold font for amount — visually prominent
      • readOnly=true: bg changes to var(--color-bg), text muted, cursor:default
      • Strips non-numeric characters on change (digits only)
      • Uses Currency type from types/index.ts

  Session 2.1 completed:
  - supabase/migrations/002_default_tag_trigger.sql — AFTER INSERT trigger on profiles:
      • Function: create_default_gift_tag(), SECURITY DEFINER, SET search_path = public
      • Looks up per-currency default amount from platform_settings using CASE on
        NEW.currency (NGN/USD/GBP/EUR → correct column). Hard fallback to 2000 if
        platform_settings is empty.
      • Inserts gift_tags row: label="Buy me a coffee ☕", is_default=true
      • DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before CREATE makes migration idempotent
      • This means signupAction's manual tag insert (in auth.actions.ts) is now
        redundant — the trigger handles it. Both can coexist safely (one will
        just no-op if the other runs first) but the trigger is the authoritative path.
  - lib/actions/tag.actions.ts — three server actions:
      getTagsByUser(userId): SELECT all tags for creator, default first (is_default
        DESC), then by created_at ASC. Returns GiftTag[] — empty array on error.
      createTag(_prevState, formData): validates label (required, ≤60 chars) and
        amount (numeric, >0). Inserts with is_default=false always. Returns
        CreateTagState { fieldErrors?, error?, success?, tag? }.
      deleteTag(tagId, userId): fetches tag first to verify ownership and is_default.
        Returns { error: 'The default tag cannot be deleted.' } if is_default=true.
        Only proceeds to DELETE after passing the is_default check. RLS policy
        also enforces is_default=false as a second layer.

  Session 2.2 completed:
  - lib/utils/currency.ts — formatCurrency(amount, currency) implemented:
      • NGN → ₦5,000 (0 decimal places, en locale thousands separator)
      • USD → $20.00 (2 decimal places)
      • GBP → £15.00 (2 decimal places)
      • EUR → €20.00 (2 decimal places)
      • Manual symbol prefix guarantees correct character regardless of ICU build
      • Matches Section 9 spec exactly
  - app/dashboard/tags/page.tsx — Server Component:
      • Gets session via supabase.auth.getSession(), redirects to /login if absent
      • Fetches profile.currency for the creator
      • Calls getTagsByUser(session.user.id) to load all tags
      • Passes tags, userId, currency to TagsClient
  - app/dashboard/tags/TagsClient.tsx — Client Component:
      • Lists all tags in a single card; each tag row is a border-divided li
      • Default tag shows terracotta "SYSTEM" badge (accent-soft bg); no remove button
      • Custom tags show "Remove" button in --color-danger; calls deleteTag directly
      • deleteTag sets deletingId state → button shows "Removing…" + is disabled
      • Delete errors surface inline below the list
      • "+ Add a new tag" text button reveals TagAddForm inline (no page navigation)
      • TagAddForm is a separate sub-component → gets a fresh useFormState every
        mount (so closing + reopening resets form state and validation errors)
      • Form fields: label (text, emoji encouraged), amount (number, currency hint
        in placeholder). Hidden user_id input. Per-field errors from createTag.
      • On successful create: form closes, router.refresh() re-fetches from server
      • On successful delete: router.refresh() re-fetches from server
      • useTransition wraps router.refresh() to avoid blocking UI
      • formatCurrency used for all amount display — no inline formatting

  Session 2.3 completed:
  - components/shared/GiftTagPill.tsx — implemented:
      • Props: tag (GiftTag), selected (boolean), onSelect (GiftTag | null) => void,
        currency (string)
      • Unselected: white bg, faint border, var(--color-text-secondary) text
      • Hover (unselected): accent-soft bg, accent border + text, translateY(-1px)
      • Selected: solid var(--color-accent) bg, white text
      • Active: scale(0.98) per Section 3.4
      • Click deselects if already selected (passes null to onSelect), selects otherwise
      • Label format: "{tag.label} · {formatCurrency(tag.amount, currency)}"
      • aria-pressed={selected} for accessibility
  - app/globals.css — added .k-tag-pill base, :hover:not(--selected), :active,
    and .k-tag-pill--selected rules

  Session 3.1 completed:
  - components/cards/ProfileCard.tsx — implemented ('use client'):
      • Avatar: shows img if avatar_url, otherwise terracotta initials circle
        (up to 2 letters from display_name split on spaces)
      • Display name — Fraunces 500 26px
      • @username — body 14px muted
      • Bio — body 14px line-height 1.65, conditional render if bio exists
      • Copy-link pill bar: shows "kiima.app/{username}" + "Copy link" / "Copied!" label;
        writes "https://kiima.app/{username}" to clipboard; resets after 2s
  - components/cards/GiftActionCard.tsx — implemented ('use client'):
      • "Send a gift" heading; renders all tags as GiftTagPill components
      • When tag selected: CurrencyInput filled with tag.amount, readOnly=true,
        hint text: "Tap the tag again to deselect and enter a custom amount."
      • When no tag: CurrencyInput is editable, label "How much?"
      • Uncontrolled by default (internal useState); accepts optional controlled props
        (selectedTag, onTagSelect, onAmountChange) for connection to payment form in Phase 4
  - app/[username]/page.tsx — Server Component:
      • Fetches profile by username from Supabase (.eq('username', params.username))
      • If not found → notFound() triggers not-found.tsx
      • Calls getTagsByUser(profile.id) to load tags
      • Renders ProfileCard + GiftActionCard in two-column auto-fit grid (minmax 300px)
      • max-width 1080px, 16px gap, 40px/20px padding
  - app/[username]/not-found.tsx — friendly 404 page:
      • 🌿 emoji, "Creator not found" heading (Fraunces), body copy, "Go home" link
      • Centered card layout, matches design system

  Session 3.2 completed:
  - lib/utils/display-name.ts — implemented:
      • resolveDisplayName(displayName, isAnonymous): all 4 cases from Section 9 —
        ("Victor", false) → "Victor", (null, false) → "Anonymous",
        ("Victor", true) → "Anonymous", (null, true) → "Anonymous"
      • formatContributionLine(contribution): Section 4.5 exactly —
        anonymous + is_default tag → "Anonymous bought a coffee ☕"
        all other cases → "{name} sent {formatCurrency(amount, currency)}"
  - lib/actions/gift.actions.ts — stub server action:
      • submitGiftAction(_prevState, formData): validates recipientId + amount > 0,
        console.logs all fields, returns { success: true }
      • Phase 4 replaces this with Paystack initialization
      • Never records a contribution — DB write is webhook-only (Section 4.6)
  - components/forms/GiftForm.tsx — implemented ('use client'):
      • Tag pills via GiftTagPill; selecting fills CurrencyInput and locks it;
        deselecting clears amount and unlocks
      • CurrencyInput for amount (auto-filled/locked when tag selected)
      • Name input — controlled, feeds into AnonymousToggle preview
      • AnonymousToggle — implements Section 4.3 Rule 4 live identity preview
      • Hidden inputs: recipient_id, tag_id, is_anonymous, amount (FormData bridge)
      • Submit button "Send gift ❤️" — disabled when amount = 0 / empty
      • Hint shown below button when disabled: "Choose a tag or enter an amount"
      • On state.success: replaces form with 🙏 success screen
      • Global error displayed above button if state.error set
  - components/shared/ContributionRow.tsx — implemented (Server Component):
      • Uses formatContributionLine() — never inlines contribution display logic
      • Shows formatted line + short date (e.g. "12 Apr")
      • isLast prop removes bottom border on final row
  - components/cards/ContributionFeedCard.tsx — implemented (Server Component):
      • Slices to first 10 contributions
      • Empty state: "No gifts yet — be the first to show love ❤️"
      • Renders ContributionRow list with border dividers
  - app/[username]/page.tsx — updated:
      • Fetches tags + confirmed direct contributions (pool_id IS NULL) in parallel
      • Joins gift_tags on contributions for is_default check in formatContributionLine
      • Layout: left col (ProfileCard + ContributionFeedCard), right col (GiftForm)
      • Replaced GiftActionCard with GiftForm

  Session 3.3 completed:
  - app/globals.css — added dashboard shell CSS:
      • .k-dash-shell (flex min-height:100vh), .k-dash-sidebar (220px sticky,
        hidden on mobile, display:flex on ≥768px), .k-dash-main (flex:1,
        padding-bottom:72px on mobile for tab bar clearance),
        .k-dash-tabs (position:fixed bottom, 64px, hidden on ≥768px)
      • .k-nav-link / .k-nav-link--active — sidebar nav links with hover/active states
      • .k-tab-link / .k-tab-link--active — mobile tab link styles
  - app/dashboard/layout.tsx — Server Component:
      • Reads session (redirects /login if absent), fetches display_name + username
      • Renders: Kiima brand wordmark, DashboardNav (sidebar), spacer, creator section
        (avatar initial circle, display name, "View my gift page →" link, LogoutButton)
      • Imports DashboardNav variant="tabs" for mobile bottom tab bar
  - app/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx — 'use client':
      • variant: 'sidebar' | 'tabs'
      • usePathname() for active state — exact match for /dashboard, startsWith for sub-routes
      • Sidebar: renders k-nav-link elements (Overview, Transactions, Gift Tags, Pools)
      • Tabs: renders k-dash-tabs nav with shorter labels (Home, Gifts, Tags, Pools)
  - app/dashboard/LogoutButton.tsx — 'use client':
      • createClient() (browser), supabase.auth.signOut(), router.push('/login'), router.refresh()
  - components/cards/DashboardStatCard.tsx — implemented (Server Component):
      • Compact 24px padding card per Section 3.3
      • Label: uppercase 11px faint; Value: 28px bold primary; Sub: 13px muted
  - app/dashboard/page.tsx — Server Component:
      • Reads session, fetches profile.currency + profile.display_name
      • 4 Supabase queries run in parallel via Promise.all:
        1. direct gift amounts (pool_id IS NULL)
        2. pool contribution amounts (pool_id IS NOT NULL)
        3. total confirmed count (head: true)
        4. 5 most recent with gift_tags join for formatContributionLine
      • Sums amounts in JS (safe for V1 data volumes)
      • 3-column stat grid (auto-fit minmax 180px)
      • Recent gifts section in a card using ContributionRow
      • Empty state: "No gifts yet — share your gift link to get started!"

  Session 4.1 completed:
  - types/index.ts — added fee: number and net_amount: number to Contribution interface
  - lib/paystack/initialize.ts — implemented initializePaystackTransaction():
      • POST https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize
      • Authorization: Bearer ${PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY}
      • amount converted to subunits (x100) inside the function
      • Passes reference (caller-generated), callback_url, metadata
      • Throws on non-OK response or Paystack status: false
      • Returns { authorizationUrl, reference }
  - lib/actions/gift.actions.ts — replaced submitGiftAction stub with initializeGift:
      • Parses form: recipient_id, tag_id, amount, display_name, is_anonymous
      • Validates amount > 0
      • Calculates fee = Math.round(amount * 0.03 * 100) / 100
      • Calculates net_amount = Math.round((amount - fee) * 100) / 100
      • Generates reference: kma_{Date.now()}_{12-char uuid fragment}
      • Fetches creator profile (currency, username) via createAdminClient()
      • Inserts PENDING contribution row via admin client (bypasses RLS)
      • Calls initializePaystackTransaction with reference, callbackUrl, metadata
      • redirect(authorizationUrl) — re-throws isRedirectError so Next.js handles it
      • On Paystack failure: deletes the pending row, returns { error: '...' }
      • Email placeholder: 'gift@kiima.app' (gifter email not collected in V1)
      • callbackUrl: {NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/{username}?gift=success
  - components/forms/GiftForm.tsx — updated:
      • Imports initializeGift instead of submitGiftAction
      • useFormState(initializeGift, null) replaces submitGiftAction
      • Removed success screen (redirect to Paystack handles the flow)
      • Added SubmitButton sub-component using useFormStatus — shows loading
        spinner while form is pending (Paystack init or redirect in flight)
      • Removed unused success screen styles (successEmojiStyle etc.)

  Session 4.2 completed:
  - lib/paystack/webhook.ts — verifyPaystackSignature(rawBody, signature):
      • HMAC-SHA512 using PAYSTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
      • timingSafeEqual to prevent timing attacks
      • Returns false if secret not configured or signature malformed/mismatched
  - lib/paystack/verify.ts — verifyPaystackTransaction(reference):
      • GET https://api.paystack.co/transaction/verify/:reference
      • Returns PaystackTransactionData (status, amount in subunits, customer, metadata)
      • Throws on non-OK response or Paystack status: false
      • Used by admin recheckPaystackPayment action (Phase 8)
  - app/api/webhooks/paystack/route.ts — POST handler:
      • Reads raw body via req.text() (required for HMAC verification)
      • Returns 401 immediately on invalid signature (only non-200 in the handler)
      • Parses JSON; on parse failure: logs 'failed' + returns 200
      • Non-charge.success events: logged as 'ignored' + returns 200
      • charge.success flow:
        1. Fetches contribution by paystack_ref via admin client
        2. If not found: logs 'failed', returns 200
        3. If already 'confirmed': logs 'ignored' (duplicate guard), returns 200
        4. Updates contribution.status → 'confirmed'
        5. If pool_id set: calls increment_pool_raised RPC; falls back to
           read-modify-write if RPC doesn't exist yet (V1 acceptable)
        6. Logs 'processed', returns 200
      • All catch paths: log 'failed' with error_message, return 200
      • logWebhookEvent() helper never throws — swallows its own errors
      • ALL DB writes use createAdminClient() (service role — no RLS)

  Session 4.3 completed:
  - app/gift/success/page.tsx — Server Component, Paystack callback page:
      • Reads ?reference= from searchParams (Paystack appends this to callbackUrl)
      • Fetches contribution by paystack_ref via public Supabase client; joins
        profiles!recipient_id to get display_name + username
      • Success state: 🙏 emoji, "Your gift was sent! Thank you" heading (Fraunces),
        green amount pill (success-soft bg, success text, formatCurrency),
        "← Back to {name}'s page" link in accent colour
      • Pending/not-found fallback: ⏳ emoji, "We're confirming your payment —
        check back shortly", "← Go home" link
      • All copy follows Section 3.5; all styles use design tokens
  - app/gift/cancelled/page.tsx — Server Component, payment abandoned page:
      • Reads optional ?from= param (creator username for "Try again" link)
      • 💛 emoji, "Payment didn't go through" heading (Fraunces)
      • Body: "No worries — nothing was charged. Try again whenever you're ready."
      • If ?from= present: "← Try again" links back to /{username}
      • If no ?from=: "← Go home" links to /
      • Note: Paystack redirect-based flow has no built-in cancel_url param —
        the cancelled page is navigated to manually or linked from the gift form
  - lib/actions/gift.actions.ts — updated callbackUrl:
      • Was: {APP_URL}/{username}?gift=success
      • Now: {APP_URL}/gift/success
      • Paystack appends ?reference=xxx&trxref=xxx to this URL on redirect

  Bug fix (Session 4.3 addendum):
  - lib/actions/gift.actions.ts — fixed display_name anonymous override:
      • Bug: isAnonymous was read AFTER displayName was computed; the anonymous
        override was never applied server-side, meaning a user's name could be
        stored even when they chose to appear as Anonymous
      • Fix: read isAnonymous first, then apply: displayName = isAnonymous ? null : rawDisplayName
      • This enforces Section 4.3 Rule 1 at the data layer (not just at display time)

  Session UX fixes (2026-04-12):
  - app/[username]/page.tsx — removed ContributionFeedCard and its contributions
    fetch; recent gifts are private — only visible in creator dashboard.
  - components/forms/GiftForm.tsx — name field is now required:
      • Required when anonymous is OFF — canSubmit blocks if name is empty
      • onBlur validation shows "Please enter your name" inline (fieldErrorStyle)
      • When anonymous toggled ON: displayName cleared, nameError cleared,
        field disabled with placeholder "Sending anonymously"
      • canSubmit = amount > 0 AND (isAnon OR displayName.trim() !== '')
  - components/shared/CurrencyInput.tsx — amount formatted with commas as user types
  - app/globals.css — added .k-input:disabled rule
  - app/[username]/error.tsx — added (new file)

## Session 2026-04-21 — CLAUDE.md housekeeping split + landing page mobile polish

### Landing page mobile CSS fixes (app/page.tsx)
- Proof bar label span: added `className="lp-proof-label"` (removed inline `marginRight`).
- 900px breakpoint: replaced `flex-direction: column` on `.lp-proof-bar` with
  `flex-basis: 100%` on `.lp-proof-label` and `justify-content: center` on the bar.
  Result: label wraps to its own row, pills flow naturally underneath in a centered row.
- 900px breakpoint: moved `.lp-how-header { flex-direction: column }` rule here
  (was at 600px, so mid-sizes like 700px weren't stacking correctly).
- 600px breakpoint: headline reduced 42px → 40px; section h2 32px → 30px;
  features h2 34px → 32px; final CTA h2 38px → 36px.
- Hero `<h1>` style object: removed duplicate `fontWeight: 400` property (kept `fontWeight: 500`).
  This was a TypeScript TS1117 duplicate object literal property error.
- `.gitignore`: added `scripts/screenshot-mobile-450.png`.

### CLAUDE.md housekeeping split
- **BUILD_LOG.md created** (project root, 767 lines) — contains full Section 14
  session history from sessions 0.2 through 2026-04-20.
- **CLAUDE.md Section 14** replaced with 3-line stub pointing at BUILD_LOG.md.
- **CLAUDE.md Standing Rule 2** updated: "Update Section 14" → "Append a new entry to BUILD_LOG.md".
- **CLAUDE.md Standing Rule 4** updated: "Section 14 is updated ✓" → "BUILD_LOG.md is updated ✓".
- **CLAUDE.md Section 12 checklist** updated: "Have I updated Section 14?" → "Have I appended this session's entry to BUILD_LOG.md?"
- **CLAUDE.md Section 16.6** updated: "Update Section 14" → "Append this session's entry to BUILD_LOG.md".
- **CLAUDE.md Section 7** trimmed: dropped "Purpose" column from Cards/Forms/Shared Atoms tables;
  Auth Pages/API Routes/Paystack Library reduced to File only; Dashboard/Public/Admin pages
  reduced to Route + File; Migration table reduced to File + Change (one phrase).
  All verbose description sentences removed — they are already in the components themselves.
- Estimated CLAUDE.md size after trimming: ~36,000–40,000 characters.
  Largest remaining sections: Section 15 (Admin Panel ~5,500 chars) and Section 4 (Domain Rules ~5,500 chars).
  If further trimming is needed, Section 15.2 (admin page descriptions) and 15.4 (duplicate component table) are candidates.

### Next tasks
- Browser test the landing page locally (`npm run dev`, open localhost:3000).
- Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel.
- After deploy: run Puppeteer screenshots on live URL for final visual audit.

### Open issues (unchanged from last session)
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase (webhook falls back to read-modify-write — safe for V1).
- og-default.png not yet created — needed as fallback og:image on gift link pages.
- Migrations 001–007 all confirmed applied to live DB.
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost (already confirmed working from live DB evidence).
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress/redirect before public launch.
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code (ContributeForm uses initializeGift since Phase 5.3).

---

## Session 2026-04-21 — CLAUDE.md housekeeping trim (size reduction)

### What was done
No code changes — CLAUDE.md only.

- **Section 7 (Component Inventory):** Trimmed ProfileCard/GiftActionCard/SupportPoolCard key props; stripped verbose Notes from Dashboard Shell and Admin Shell tables.
- **Section 4.6 (Payment Flow):** Replaced 39-line annotated code block with 7 bullet points. Kept fee model table, example, and critical rules intact.
- **Section 15.2 (Admin Pages):** Replaced 8 verbose page descriptions with a single compact table (one line per page).
- **Section 15.3:** Removed intro paragraph (kept the 6 rule bullets).
- **Section 15.4:** Removed "Add to Section 7 as built" preamble.
- **Section 15.5:** Collapsed TypeScript code block to a single inline list of 6 function names.
- **Section 6 (Architecture Tree):** Stripped all inline `← comments` except the 2 critical ones (`shadcn/ui do not edit`, `ALL design tokens live here`). Added `fee.ts` and `admin.actions.ts` which were missing from the tree.
- **Section 8 (TypeScript Types):** Replaced full interface definitions with a brief pointer to `types/index.ts` + the 5 non-obvious Contribution fee fields.
- **Section 9 (Utility Functions):** Condensed `calculateAllFees` and `formatFeeBreakdown` examples; trimmed `resolveDisplayName` to 2 examples.
- **Section 16 (Landing Page Brief):** Removed embedded Puppeteer script (already in `scripts/screenshot.js`); condensed 16.1/16.2/16.4; removed Step 2 puppeteer install (already done).
- **Section 12 (Checklist):** Removed verbose confirmation notes from 2 checklist items.
- **Section 4.6 fee description:** Trimmed 3-bullet explanations to 1-liners.
- **Section 4.4:** Condensed closed-pool display rules to 1 line.
- **Section 15.1:** Condensed Rules 3, 4, 5 slightly.

### Size result
52,000 chars → **39,951 chars** (under 40,000 target).

### Next tasks
- Browser test the landing page locally (`npm run dev`).
- Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel.
- After deploy: run `node scripts/screenshot.js` against live URL for final visual audit.

### Open issues (unchanged)
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase (webhook falls back to read-modify-write — safe for V1).
- og-default.png not yet created — needed as fallback og:image on gift link pages.
- Migrations 001–007 all confirmed applied to live DB.
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost.
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress/redirect before public launch.
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code.

## Session 2026-04-21 — Public gift page redesign (app/[username]/page.tsx)

### What was built
Full redesign of the creator public gift page. Replaced the two-column ProfileCard + GiftForm grid with a mobile-first (480px max-width) single-column layout inspired by Buy Me a Coffee.

### New files
- `components/shared/DrinkQuantitySelector.tsx` — pill selector (1/3/5/10 drinks) with live ₦ total in Fraunces font
- `components/shared/SocialHandleInput.tsx` — compound input with Instagram/X/TikTok platform picker dropdown (SVG icons, click-outside close, useRef)
- `components/pages/GiftPageClient.tsx` — 'use client' wrapper for Sections 2–4 + footer:
  - Section 2: gift card with DrinkQuantitySelector + SocialHandleInput + anonymous checkbox + note textarea (UI-only, no `name` attr, V2) + live fee breakdown + submit button
  - Section 3: recent supporters list with avatar/initials, activityLine helper ("bought X drinks" or "sent ₦X"), timeAgo helper
  - Section 4: About section (only rendered if bio exists), SocialLinksRow below bio
  - Footer: "Powered by Kiima"

### Updated files
- `app/[username]/page.tsx` — server component now:
  - Fetches recent contributions (last 10, confirmed, no pool_id) + contributor count in parallel with existing data
  - Renders Section 1 inline: warm terracotta gradient cover (no cover_image_url column exists), overlapping avatar (80px, border, shadow), display_name + @username centred
  - Passes all data to GiftPageClient; ProfileCard and GiftForm no longer used on this page

### Design decisions
- Cover: gradient placeholder (`linear-gradient(135deg, --color-accent, --color-accent-light, --color-accent-soft)`) — no DB column for cover images in V1
- Avatar overlap: `position: relative` wrapper with negative `marginTop: -40px`
- Note textarea: rendered in UI (user requested it) but `name` attr omitted — server never receives value (V2 feature per Section 10)
- tag_id logic: defaultTag.id when qty=1 (maps to single-drink default tag), empty string for qty 3/5/10 (no suitable tag, custom amount)
- About section conditionally rendered only when bio is non-null/non-empty

### Next tasks
- Take screenshot at 390px and verify all checklist items from Section 16.3
- Push to GitHub
- After deploy: full visual check on mobile device

### Open issues (unchanged)
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress before public launch
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code

## Session 2026-04-24 — Dashboard redesign (mobile-first)

### What was built
Full redesign of `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to a mobile-first, mobile-app-style layout
(max-width 480px, no sidebar, fixed bottom nav).

### New files
- `components/dashboard/BottomNav.tsx` — fixed 4-tab bottom nav: Home / Pools / Links / Settings. Uses lucide-react icons. Replaces old `DashboardNav variant="tabs"`.
- `components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` — avatar circle (image or initials) on left, native share button (navigator.share + clipboard fallback) on right. No title text.
- `components/dashboard/LinkBar.tsx` — `kiima.app/{username}` in terracotta text + Copy icon button with 2s "Copied ✓" state.
- `components/dashboard/GiftTagsRow.tsx` — horizontally scrollable tag pills. Default tag is filled terracotta (no delete). Custom tags have an X button to delete. "+ Add gift tag" dashed pill opens a bottom-sheet modal (full-width, slides up) with label + amount inputs and createTag server action. Uses useTransition + router.refresh() to update without full reload.
- `components/dashboard/StatCards.tsx` — 3-column equal-width stat grid: Gifts received / Pool support / Total earned. Fraunces font for values.
- `components/dashboard/RecentGifts.tsx` — last 5 confirmed contributions. Each row: 38px avatar (🥤 emoji if anonymous, initials otherwise, soft rotating bg colours), name + tag label + relative time, gift amount + creator amount. "See all →" links to /dashboard/transactions. Empty state with 🥤 emoji and share prompt.
- `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — minimal placeholder: shows creator name + @username, "View page →" link, and LogoutButton. Prevents the Settings nav tab from 404-ing.

### Updated files
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — full rewrite. Fetches all data in a single Promise.all (profile, direct gifts, pool gifts, total count, recent 5, tags, active pools count). Uses gift_amount (not creator_amount) for stat totals per new spec.
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — stripped sidebar entirely. Now: session guard only → wraps children in 480px centred main + renders BottomNav. Old sidebar, DashboardNav, creator section removed.
- `package.json` — added `lucide-react` dependency.

### TypeScript
PASSED clean — `npx tsc --noEmit` with no errors.

### Architecture change notes
- The sidebar is permanently removed. Dashboard is now mobile-app style at all screen sizes.
- `DashboardNav.tsx` and its CSS classes (`.k-dash-sidebar`, `.k-nav-link`, `.k-dash-tabs`, `.k-tab-link`) remain in the codebase but are no longer used by the layout. They can be deleted in a cleanup session.
- The Settings page at `/dashboard/settings` is a minimal placeholder — needs a full build (avatar upload, display name edit, currency selector, notification preferences) in a future session.

---

## Session 2026-04-24 — Gift page UI cleanup (5 targeted changes)

### What was changed

**`components/pages/GiftPageClient.tsx`**
- Removed fee breakdown `<p>` element ("Processing fee ₦X · Total charged ₦X"). Fee is still calculated and applied server-side in `initializeGift` — only the display was removed.
- Removed `fees` variable and `calculateAllFees` import (were only used for the display line).
- Removed `feeLineStyle` constant.

**`components/shared/DrinkQuantitySelector.tsx`**
- Removed `<p>= ₦2,000</p>` total display and `totalStyle` constant (amount is already shown in the submit button — Change 2).
- Removed `formatCurrency` import and `const total` variable (no longer needed after Change 2).
- Wrapped the entire quantity row in a soft tray container: `background: var(--color-accent-soft)`, `border-radius: var(--radius-md)`, `padding: 12px 16px` — Change 3.
- Changed `FIXED_QUANTITIES` from `[1, 3, 5, 10]` to `[1, 3, 5]`. Replaced the "10" circle pill with a square `<input type="number">` — `borderRadius: 15%`, same `44px` height as pills, terracotta border — Change 4.
- Custom input logic: typing a number calls `onSelect(num)`; if the typed number matches 1/3/5, the corresponding pill highlights; if it doesn't match, the input itself gets selected (terracotta fill) styling.
- `DrinkQty` type changed from `1 | 3 | 5 | 10` to `number` (exported, so parent `GiftPageClient.tsx` automatically picks up the change via the type import).

**`components/shared/SocialHandleInput.tsx`**
- Added `const showSocialPicker = value.startsWith('@')` — Change 5.
- Platform picker button (icon + chevron) now conditionally rendered: only shown when `showSocialPicker` is true.
- Dropdown now conditionally rendered: `{showSocialPicker && dropdownOpen && <div>...}`.
- Input placeholder: `"Name or @yoursocial"` by default; `"yourusername"` when `showSocialPicker` is true.
- Added `useEffect` to call `onDropdownClose()` when `showSocialPicker` becomes false (user deleted the `@`).

### TypeScript
PASSED clean — `npx tsc --noEmit` with no errors.

### Next tasks
- Build `/dashboard/settings` page fully (display name, bio, avatar, currency, logout)
- Remove unused DashboardNav.tsx + stale CSS classes from globals.css
- Add loading skeleton for new dashboard home layout
- Consider adding `suspense` boundaries around the new dashboard components

### Open issues (unchanged)
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress before public launch
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code

---

## Session 11 — 2026-04-24

### What was built
**Part 1 (previous session):** BottomNav "Links" tab → "Tags" tab, pointing to `/dashboard/tags`.

**Part 2 — Full Tags page rewrite:**
- `lib/actions/tag.actions.ts` — added `updateTag` (validates ownership + not-default, updates label + amount)
- `components/dashboard/Toast.tsx` — fixed bottom-center toast, auto-dismiss 3s, success/error variants, slide-up animation
- `components/dashboard/AddTagModal.tsx` — bottom-sheet modal with `createTag` server action, field validation, close on backdrop click
- `components/dashboard/EditTagModal.tsx` — same sheet pattern, pre-filled with existing tag values, calls `updateTag`
- `app/dashboard/tags/TagsClient.tsx` — full rewrite: system tag in dedicated card (locked/cannot edit), custom tags with Edit + inline remove confirmation (no accidental one-click deletes), optimistic local state, toast on all mutations
- `app/globals.css` — added `@keyframes slide-up` and `@keyframes fade-in` for modal animations

**Part 3 — Settings page rewrite:**
- `lib/actions/auth.actions.ts` — added `updateProfile(userId, display_name, bio, avatar_url?)` server action
- `app/dashboard/settings/SettingsClient.tsx` — new client component: 72px avatar circle (click to upload via Supabase Storage), display name + bio form with `updateProfile`, `SocialLinksForm` reused for social links section, email display (read-only), logout button with danger colour
- `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — rewritten to fetch full profile + social links, render `SettingsClient`

### TypeScript
PASSED clean — `npx tsc --noEmit` with no errors.

### What to build next
- Remove unused `DashboardNav.tsx` + stale CSS classes (`.k-nav-link`, `.k-dash-sidebar`) from globals.css
- Dashboard home loading skeleton for the new layout
- Suspense boundaries around dashboard components
- `/dashboard/links` page still exists separately — decide if it should be removed now that social links live in Settings

### Open issues
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress before public launch
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code
- Avatar hover overlay requires CSS :hover — currently opacity is always 0 in SettingsClient (inline style limitation); add onMouseEnter/Leave handler to show the "Edit" label on hover

---

## Session 12 — 2026-04-25

### What was built

**Change 1 — Default tag label: "Buy me a coffee ☕" → "Buy me a drink 🥤"**
- `supabase/migrations/008_update_default_tag.sql` — created; run in Supabase SQL Editor to update all existing default tags in production
- `supabase/migrations/002_default_tag_trigger.sql` — updated trigger so all new signups get "Buy me a drink 🥤"
- `CLAUDE.md` Sections 4.2, 4.5, 9, schema comment — all updated
- `app/page.tsx` — two occurrences updated (FAQ answer + feature description)
- `lib/actions/auth.actions.ts` — comment updated
- `lib/utils/slug.ts` — comment example updated
- `app/admin/settings/SettingsForm.tsx` — heading updated

**Change 2 — DashboardHeader redesign**
- `components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` — full rewrite: 56px avatar top-left (UserCircle grey fallback if no photo), Share2 icon top-right (24px, navigator.share with clipboard fallback), display name 24px/700 weight left-aligned 16px below avatar, kiima.app/username + Copy icon (16px) on same line with "Copied!" inline tooltip for 2s, no card/border/shadow — sits on var(--color-bg) directly
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — removed LinkBar import and usage; link is now embedded in DashboardHeader

### TypeScript
PASSED clean — `npx tsc --noEmit` with no errors.

### What to build next
- Remove unused `DashboardNav.tsx` + stale CSS classes from globals.css
- Remove or redirect `/dashboard/links` page (social links now in Settings)
- Dashboard home loading skeleton for the new layout

### Open issues
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress before public launch
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code
- Avatar hover overlay in SettingsClient — add onMouseEnter/Leave to show "Edit" label
- Dashboard header/tags can't be screenshotted (auth-gated) — verify manually in browser
- Migration 008 must be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor — not auto-applied

---

## Session 13 — 2026-04-25

### What was built
Domain rename: `kiima.co` → `kiima.app` across the entire codebase.

Files updated:
- `app/[username]/page.tsx` — fallback APP_URL
- `app/[username]/pool/[slug]/page.tsx` — fallback APP_URL
- `app/page.tsx` — 5 occurrences (FAQ copy, steps copy, CTA copy, contact email, browser mockup)
- `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` — username preview display
- `app/dashboard/pools/page.tsx` — fallback APP_URL + display URL
- `lib/actions/gift.actions.ts` — placeholder email `gift@kiima.app`
- `components/pages/GiftPageClient.tsx` — footer "Powered by Kiima" href
- `components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` — fallback APP_URL + displayLink
- `components/dashboard/LinkBar.tsx` — fallback APP_URL + display text
- `components/cards/ProfileCard.tsx` — linkDisplay text
- `CLAUDE.md` — Section 4.4 pool URL, Section 11 env var comment
- `BUILD_LOG.md` — all historical `kiima.co` references
- `.env.example` — created (did not exist); `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://kiima.app`

Not changed (no `kiima.co` references):
- `middleware.ts` — clean
- `next.config.mjs` — empty config, no image domains

Final grep: `kiima.co` → **0 results** across all .ts, .tsx, .js, .json, .md files.

### TypeScript
Not run — no logic or type changes, only string literals.

### What to build next
- Remove unused `DashboardNav.tsx` + stale CSS from globals.css
- Remove or redirect `/dashboard/links` page
- Dashboard home loading skeleton

### Open issues
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress before public launch
- contributePool stub in pool.actions.ts is dead code
- Avatar hover overlay in SettingsClient — add onMouseEnter/Leave
- Migration 008 must be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor

---

## Session 14 — 2026-04-25

### What was fixed
**Copy link copying Vercel URL instead of kiima.app**

Root cause: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` was set to the Vercel deployment URL
in Vercel's environment variables. Since NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars are baked
into the bundle at build time, the Vercel value overrode the `?? 'https://kiima.app'`
fallback in the code.

The code in `DashboardHeader.tsx` and `LinkBar.tsx` was already correct
(both use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL ?? 'https://kiima.app'`).
No `window.location.origin` was found anywhere.

Changes made:
- `components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` — added warning comment above
  appUrl construction pointing to Vercel env var requirement

**Action required by Victor:**
Go to Vercel Dashboard → kiima project → Settings → Environment Variables
→ set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://kiima.app` for Production environment
→ redeploy (or trigger a new deployment) for the change to take effect

### TypeScript
No logic changes — comment only.

### What to build next
- Remove unused DashboardNav.tsx + stale CSS from globals.css
- Remove or redirect /dashboard/links page
- Dashboard home loading skeleton

### Open issues
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL must be corrected in Vercel env vars + redeploy
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Webhook testing requires ngrok on localhost
- gift@kiima.app placeholder email — suppress before public launch
- Avatar hover overlay in SettingsClient — add onMouseEnter/Leave
- Migration 008 must be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor

## Session 13 — 2026-04-25 — Design System Sweep (Neobrutalist)

### What was built
Complete design system sweep across the Kiima codebase to implement the neobrutalist design language.

**Foundation (Phase 1):**
- `tailwind.config.ts` — added `kiima.black`, `kiima.white`, `kiima.olive`, `kiima.orange` colors; `sans` font family; `borderRadius.none`
- `styles/tokens.css` — added `--kiima-*` CSS variables; set all `--radius-*` tokens to `0px`; updated `--font-display: var(--font-body)`; updated shadow tokens to neobrutalist hard-offset style (`4px 4px 0 0 #000000`)
- `app/globals.css` — added `* { border-radius: 0px !important }` global reset; heartbeat animation for KiimaButton; typography scale (h1/h2/h3/p); updated all k-btn/k-tag-pill/k-currency-pill/k-input/k-nav-link CSS to use neobrutalist borders and olive/orange accents
- `app/layout.tsx` — removed Fraunces import; updated Plus Jakarta Sans weights to 400/500/600/700/800
- `components/shared/KiimaButton.tsx` — complete rewrite: 2-layer neobrutalist structure (wrapper + shadow span + face button); `light` and `dark` variants with olive/orange; backward-compat `ghost` and `danger` variants; heartbeat SVG; size variants `sm/md/lg/xl`

**Page Sweep (Phase 2):**
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced `lp-btn` CSS variants with neobrutalist hard-shadow style; updated proof-bar pills, pricing cards, testimonial cards to use `border: 2px solid #000; box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 0 #000`; updated how-it-works step numbers to olive/black; updated logo to `font-weight: 800`; updated h1/h2/h3 styles to `font-weight: 800` throughout
- `components/dashboard/BottomNav.tsx` — border changed to `2px solid #000`; active color updated to black
- `components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` — `var(--font-body)` → `var(--kiima-font)`
- `components/dashboard/StatCards.tsx` — amount values now use `font-family: monospace; font-weight: 800`
- `components/dashboard/RecentGifts.tsx` — gift amount column now uses `font-family: monospace; font-weight: 800`

**Typography (Phase 3):**
- Added `.k-amount` and `.k-label` utility classes to globals.css
- Added global h1/h2/h3/p typography rules with `font-weight: 800`, clamped `font-size`, tight `letter-spacing`

### What to build next
- Visual QA pass — check all pages for broken layouts from border-radius reset
- Avatar circles specifically: need `border-radius: 50% !important` exception or wrapper approach
- Verify KiimaButton renders correctly at all sizes on auth pages, gift form, pool form
- Consider adding neobrutalist borders to all card containers

### Open issues (inherited)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL must be corrected in Vercel env vars + redeploy
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed to Supabase
- og-default.png not yet created
- Avatar circles will be square due to `border-radius: 0px !important` — needs fix
- k-spinner (loading animation) uses border-radius:50% — will be square (cosmetic bug)

---

## Session 15 — 2026-04-25 — Neobrutalist sweep follow-up + Phase 4 audit

### What was fixed

**Fixed black navbar (landing page):**
- `app/page.tsx` — nav changed from `position: sticky` to `position: fixed, top:0, left:0, right:0, zIndex:100`
- Background: `rgba(246,243,238,0.92)` → `#000000`
- Logo text: warm text → `#ffffff` with olive dot
- Nav links: new `.lp-nav-link` class (`rgba(255,255,255,0.72)`, hover `#ffffff`)
- "Log in" link: `rgba(255,255,255,0.6)` white
- "Get started →" CTA: new `.lp-btn-nav` class — olive bg, orange hard shadow, black text
- Mobile nav: shows only CTA button (`.lp-nav-mobile .lp-btn-nav`)
- Added `<div style={{ height: 68 }} />` spacer to prevent content overlap

**Avatar circles + k-spinner fix:**
- `app/globals.css` — removed `!important` from `* { border-radius: 0px }` global reset
- Inline `borderRadius: '50%'` styles now win (higher CSS priority than `*` selector)
- `.k-spinner { border-radius: 50% }` class also wins (higher specificity than `*`)
- Both avatar circles and loading spinner are now correctly round

### Phase 4 Audit Summary

CONFIRMED WORKING:
- Shadow tokens (`--shadow-card`, `--shadow-btn`) resolve to `4px 4px 0 0 #000` — 16 component files auto-updated
- Font tokens: `--font-display: var(--font-body)` resolves to PJS — no components need changes
- Border-radius tokens: all `--radius-*` are `0px` — zero `rounded-*` Tailwind classes found
- KiimaButton: light/dark/ghost/danger variants all correct
- Landing page navbar: fixed black, olive CTA, white links

STILL PENDING:
- Card borders throughout the app: still `1px solid var(--color-border)` (soft rgba). Need `2px solid #000000` per neobrutalist spec. 30+ files affected — large blast radius, deferred.
- Visual QA: no browser test run yet across dashboard, gift page, pool page, admin pages
- Admin pages: no neobrutalist sweep — deferred pending user decision

### What to build next
- Update card borders to `2px solid #000000` across all components
- Visual QA pass in browser across all pages
- KiimaButton size check on auth, gift form, pool form

### Open issues
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL must be set in Vercel env vars
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed
- og-default.png not yet created
- Card borders need neobrutalist update (30+ files)
- No browser visual QA performed yet

## Session 16 — 2026-04-25 — Hero redesign: floating coins + centered layout

### What was changed

**`app/page.tsx` — hero section:**
- Removed 2-column `lp-hero-grid` layout and phone mockup
- Replaced with centered single-column `.lp-hero-center` layout
- Hero text now centered (`text-align: center`, `align-items: center`, `max-width` on h1 and sub)
- Headline font size increased: `clamp(44px, 6vw, 72px)` (was 64px max)
- Added 4 floating `KiimaCoin` elements positioned absolutely around the section edges (Gumroad-style)
- Hero section: `position: relative; overflow: hidden`
- Removed `PhoneMockup` function (dead code after hero redesign)
- Added `KiimaCoin` component: SVG coin with olive `#D7D744` face, dark olive `#7a7a00` depth layer, black heart icon
- Coin positions: top-left (210px, -25°), top-right (148px, +18°), left-mid (245px, -10°), bottom-right (172px, +28°)
- CSS: `.lp-hero-grid` → `.lp-hero-center`; 900px breakpoint updated; `lp-hero-phone` CSS removed

TypeScript: PASSED clean.

### What to build next
- Visual QA the hero on desktop + mobile (coins should clip at edges, text should be centered)
- Card borders neobrutalist sweep

### Open issues
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL must be set in Vercel env vars
- increment_pool_raised RPC not yet deployed
- og-default.png not yet created
- Card borders need neobrutalist update (30+ files)


---

## Session 17 — 2026-04-25 — Desktop dashboard sidebar layout

### What was built

NEW FILE: `components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx` — black sidebar (200px), olive active state, logo + 4 nav items. Client component, hidden on mobile via `.k-dash-sidebar` CSS class.

MODIFIED:
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — added DashboardSidebar; shell is now display:flex; main uses `.k-dash-content`.
- `components/dashboard/BottomNav.tsx` — added className="k-bottom-nav" for hide on desktop.
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — DashboardHeader wrapped in `.k-dash-header-mobile`; "Dashboard" h1 added (desktop only).
- `app/globals.css` — updated `.k-dash-sidebar` to black/olive; added `.k-dash-content`, `.k-bottom-nav`, `.k-dash-page-title`, `.k-dash-header-mobile`.
- `CLAUDE.md` Section 7 — updated component table and layout description.

RESPONSIVE: Mobile: BottomNav + centred 480px. Desktop: sidebar + wide content.
TypeScript: PASSED clean.

### Open issues
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL must be set in Vercel env vars
- Card borders need neobrutalist update (30+ files)

```
Date: 2026-04-26
Session: 13 � Google OAuth signup & login

WHAT WAS BUILT:

  NEW FILES:
  - components/shared/GoogleButton.tsx
      Full-width white Google OAuth button. Official 4-colour Google G SVG (inline).
      Loading state: spinner + "Redirecting..." text while OAuth redirect is in flight.
      Calls supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google', options: { redirectTo: APP_URL/auth/callback } })

  - app/auth/callback/route.ts
      Google OAuth PKCE code exchange route (separate from /api/auth/callback which handles
      password reset). Exchanges code for session, then checks if a profiles row exists:
        - Profile found   ? redirect /dashboard  (returning user)
        - No profile      ? redirect /onboarding (new Google user)

  - app/onboarding/page.tsx
      2-step profile setup flow for new Google users.
      Step 1: display name (pre-filled from Google full_name), username (real-time availability
              check via checkUsernameAvailable), currency selector (default NGN).
      Step 2: bank details placeholder � skip to dashboard (no BankDetailsForm built yet).
      Guards: redirects to /login if unauthenticated; redirects to /dashboard if profile exists.

  MODIFIED FILES:
  - lib/actions/auth.actions.ts
      + checkUsernameAvailable(username): validates format/reserved words, queries profiles.
        Returns { available: boolean, error?: string }
      + completeGoogleOnboarding(data): gets userId server-side from session (never trusts client),
        inserts profile row via admin client, returns fieldErrors or success.

  - app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
      GoogleButton added above email form. "or" divider between them.

  - app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx
      GoogleButton added above signup form. "or" divider between them.

  - middleware.ts
      auth/callback added to matcher exclusion (route handles its own session exchange).
      Added: unauthenticated users hitting /onboarding ? redirect /login.

  - CLAUDE.md Section 7
      Added GoogleButton, MarketingHeader, updated auth pages + API routes + server actions tables.

OPEN ISSUES / NEXT STEPS:
  - BankDetailsForm (step 2 of onboarding) is a placeholder � needs full implementation
    when bank detail collection is scoped (V2 subaccount flow).
  - Google OAuth provider must be enabled in Supabase dashboard (confirmed already done).
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL env var must be set correctly in Vercel for redirect URL to work.
  - og-default.png still not created.
  - All migrations 001�008 must be run on live Supabase.
```

```
Date: 2026-04-26
Session: 14 � Loops email integration

WHAT WAS BUILT:

  NEW FILES:
  - lib/loops/client.ts
      Exports `loops` (LoopsClient instance or null if LOOPS_API_KEY not set).
      Graceful null prevents crashes in dev without the key.
      Package: `loops` (npm) � NOT @loops-so/node which does not exist.

  - lib/loops/emails.ts
      4 exported async functions � all wrapped in try/catch, all return
      { success } | { success, error }, never throw:
        sendWelcomeEmail        � triggered after email signup + Google onboarding
        sendGiftReceivedEmail   � triggered by webhook on confirmed direct gift
        sendPoolContributionEmail � triggered by webhook on confirmed pool contribution
                                    (uses poolGoalReached template when isGoalReached)
        createLoopsContact      � triggered after signup; creates CRM contact with
                                  userGroup=creators, custom fields username/currency
      TEMPLATE_IDS object at top � all values are REPLACE_WITH_LOOPS_TEMPLATE_ID
      placeholders until Victor creates templates in Loops dashboard.

  - supabase/migrations/009_contribution_note.sql
      ALTER TABLE contributions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS note text;
      MUST be run in Supabase SQL Editor before gift email notes appear.

  MODIFIED FILES:
  - lib/actions/auth.actions.ts
      + import sendWelcomeEmail, createLoopsContact from lib/loops/emails
      + After profile INSERT in signupAction: Promise.allSettled([welcome, contact])
      + After profile INSERT in completeGoogleOnboarding: same pattern
      Both use Promise.allSettled � email failure never blocks account creation.

  - lib/actions/gift.actions.ts
      + Reads `note` from formData (trimmed, null if empty)
      + Saves note to contributions INSERT (ready for when GiftForm adds the field)

  - app/api/webhooks/paystack/route.ts
      + import formatCurrency, sendGiftReceivedEmail, sendPoolContributionEmail
      + Contribution select expanded to include recipient_id, is_anonymous,
        display_name, currency, tag_id, note (in addition to existing fields)
      + sendCreatorNotificationEmail() helper called after status ? confirmed
        - Fetches creator email via supabase.auth.admin.getUserById()
        - Fetches creator profile for display_name + username
        - Direct gift: fetches tag label if tag_id set, calls sendGiftReceivedEmail
        - Pool gift: fetches pool row (title/raised/goal/slug), calls sendPoolContributionEmail
        - Entire email block wrapped in try/catch � email failure never breaks webhook

  - types/index.ts
      + note: string | null added to Contribution interface

  - CLAUDE.md Section 7 (Migrations table)
      + 009_contribution_note.sql entry added

IMPORTANT � ACTION REQUIRED BEFORE EMAILS WORK:
  1. Run migration 009 in Supabase SQL Editor
  2. Add LOOPS_API_KEY to .env.local and Vercel environment variables
  3. Create 5 email templates in Loops dashboard and replace all
     REPLACE_WITH_LOOPS_TEMPLATE_ID values in lib/loops/emails.ts:
       welcome, giftReceived, poolContribution, poolGoalReached, confirmEmail
  4. Data variables available per template:
       welcome:          first_name, username, dashboard_url, gift_link
       giftReceived:     first_name, sender_name, gift_amount, tag_used,
                         note_preview, dashboard_url
       poolContribution: first_name, sender_name, gift_amount, pool_title,
                         pool_raised, pool_goal, pool_percent, pool_url
       poolGoalReached:  same as poolContribution

OPEN ISSUES:
  - GiftForm UI does not yet have a note input field � note is saved server-side
    but gifters cannot enter one until the field is added to GiftForm/ContributeForm
  - confirmEmail template wired but never triggered (Supabase handles confirmation
    emails natively � this slot is reserved for a custom flow if needed)
  - og-default.png still not created
```
